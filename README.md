# Network-matrix-extraction
Matlab codes used to extract network adjacency matrix of mitochondria-mitochondria interaction networks (MINs) from 3D images

To extract mitochondria-mitochondria interaction adjacency matrix, one need to first download all the *.m files from this repository 
to one destination folder and run 'MainSorted_PAforFeng_20181127Publication.m' in Matlab.

Of course, one need to modify the folder path of your images to be analyzed using Matlab scripts.
