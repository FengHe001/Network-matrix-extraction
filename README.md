# Network-matrix-extraction
Matlab codes used to extract network adjacency matrix of mitochondria-mitochondria interaction networks (MINs) from 3D images

If you use our scripts, please give us the credits by citing us (Zanin et al., Mitochondria interaction networks show altered topological patterns in Parkinsonâ€™s disease, npj Systems Biology and Applications, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41540-020-00156-4). For more information, please contact Feng HE (Feng.he@lih.lu) or Paul Antony (paul.antony@uni.lu).

To extract mitochondria-mitochondria interaction adjacency matrix, one need to first download all the *.m files from this repository 
to one destination folder and run 'MainSorted_PAforFeng_20181127Publication.m' in Matlab.

Of note, one need to modify the folder paths of your images to be analyzed.
