To extract mitochondria-mitochondria interaction adjacency matrix, one need to first download all the *.m files from this repository 
to one destination folder and run 'MainSorted_PAforFeng_20181127Publication.m' in Matlab.

Of note, one need to modify the folder paths of your images to be analyzed.
